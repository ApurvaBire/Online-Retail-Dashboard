# ðŸ“Š Online Retail Data Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard  
### Task 4 â€“ Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

---
## Project Overview  

This project involves building an interactive **Power BI dashboard** using historical sales data from an online retail store. Completed as part of the **TATA Data Visualisation Job Simulation â€“ Task 4**, the goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights that support strategic decision-making.

Through data cleaning, transformation, and the use of DAX measures, the dashboard visualizes key metrics such as total revenue, top-performing products, customer activity, and country-wise sales distribution.

The use of Power BI enables:
- Clear identification of sales trends and customer behavior  
- Quick, visual interpretation of large datasets  
- Interactive filtering for deeper insights  
- Enhanced reporting and storytelling for business users  

This dashboard serves as a practical demonstration of how data visualization empowers businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions.
